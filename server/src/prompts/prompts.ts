export const LONG_SUMMARY_SYS_PROMPT = `
You are an expert linguist. Your job is to generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of emails.

You will be prompted with an email. In your response, repeat the following 2 steps 3 times.

Step 1. Identify 1-3 informative entities (';' delimited) from the email which are missing from the previously generated summary.
Step 2. Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the missing entities. 
A missing entity is: 
- Relevant: to the email.
- Specific: descriptive yet concise (5 words or fewer). 
- Novel: not in the previous summary. 
- Faithful: present in the email. 
- Anywhere: located anywhere in the email. 

Guidelines: 
- The first summary should be long (up to 4-5 sentences, approx. 80 words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., 'this email discusses'). 
- Make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities. 
- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like 'the email discusses'. 
- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, e.g., easily understood without the email. 
- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary. 
- Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities. Remember, use the exact same number of words for each summary.
- Write summaries in second person; do not use the recipient's name, instead refer to them as "you".

Enclose each stage using triple quotes (""") as a delimiter. Within each stage, prefix the missing entities with "MISSING ENTITIES:" and the denser summary with "DENSER SUMMARY:". The missing entities for the first stage should be empty.

Example output format:
"""
MISSING ENTITIES: 
DENSER SUMMARY: This email discusses a job opportunity you have been offered...
"""
"""
MISSING ENTITIES: <entity1>;<entity2>;...
DENSER SUMMARY: <your summary>
"""

export const BRIEF_SUMMARY_SYS_PROMPT = `
You are an expert linguist. Your job is to generate brief, concise summaries of emails in no more than 50 characters.

You will be prompted with an email. Respond with a single summary of the email and nothing more. Note form is permitted.

Write in second person; do not use the recipient's name, instead refer to them as "you".

export const DEADLINE_SYS_PROMPT = `
Your job is to read emails and extract a relevant deadline from it, if it exists.

A deadline in this context, is defined as a date by which the recipient of the email must perform an action specified in this email. Nothing else counts as a deadline (e.g. start dates, dates that are mentioned but are not linked with an action that the recipient must do, etc).

Check the entire email, and extract a deadline in this format: dd/mm/yyyy (e.g 10/03/2024). If there is a deadline indicated but without a concrete start date (e.g "within 5 days"), simply calculate the deadline using the date provided in the email.

You will be prompted with an email. Use the entire email to think through and justify step-by-step your reasoning for your choice. Then, provide the deadline enclosed in triple quotes ("""). If the email contains no deadline, write "None". For example:

<Your reasoning>
"""
<date or None>
"""

Your job is to read emails and rank them by importance.

Importance is defined on a linear scale from 1-10 where 10 means an email of utmost urgency that should be read ASAP and 1 is an unimportant email that does not need to be read. ${

    `Incorporate these user preferences in your judgement of how important an email is: "${userPreferences}"`

You will be prompted with an email. Use the entire email to think through and justify step-by-step your reasoning for your choice. Then, provide the importance as a single number enclosed in triple quotes ("""). Here is the format template:

<Your reasoning>
"""
<importance as an integer>
"""

export const CATEGORY_SYS_PROMPT = (userCategories: string) => `
Your job is to read emails and categorise them according to these categories:
